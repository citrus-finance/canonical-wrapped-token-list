## Canonical Wrapped Token List

> 




### Documentation

The token list should follow the specs as defined here: https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists and should only include wrapped native tokens (like WETH, WBNB, ...).


#### Extensions

`isNative` (boolean): If true the token is an ERC20 interface for the native currency.
